# translation_tarahumara_to_umkansanion 
The problem is basically to convert the songs in Tarahumara script to the Umkansanion script, the problem is explained at the start in the file program01.py, which is where the whole source code is. To run the tests on the program download the file from: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1jD1BDH0PBldir-yo3vnE0V80NXzriUsP?usp=sharing  After downoading run test_01.py, which will run all the tests, after it will show the number of tests passed in the terminal with the time taken.
In summary, I have to access the index.txt file in the test*n* (n being a number) folder. The index.txt file contains the song names and file paths on each line. After spereating the paths, I will access the song file in that path, convert it to the Umkansanion script, and then save the file as the song name (which was with the path in the index.txt).
In Tarahumara scripts the songs are written in digits and from right to left, whereas in umknasanion scipt the songs are written in using the English alphabets (latin script) and from left to right. The algorithm.txt file explains the algorithm I used to solve the problem. 
This problem tests my abilties of handling files i.e. wrting and reading files using Python, the ability to use lists, list comprehensions, dictionaries, conditionals, loops, functions in Python.
