# translation_tarahumara_to_umkansanion
Conversion of the songs in Tarahumara songs into the Umkansanion script. 
The problem is basically to convert the song in Tarahumara script to the Umkansanion script, it is explained at the start in the file program01.py, which is where the whole source code is. To run the tests on the program download all the files from: 
In summary, I have to access the index.txt file in the test*n* (n being a number) folder. The index.txt file contains the song names and file paths on each line. I will have to use my Python skills access each file, then each line in that file, then seperate the song name and file paths. 
I have to access the song files using the paths given in the index.txt, next I have to translate the files, now, in Tarahumara scripts the songs are written in digits and from right to left, whereas in umknasanion scipt the songs are written in using the Alphabets and from left to right, there are many factors, kindly refer to the starting paragraph of the program01.py file, the paragraph is the problem. The algorithm.txt file explains the algorithm I used to solve the problem. 
This problem tests my abilties of handling files i.e. wrting and reading files using Python, tests the ability to use lists, list comprehensions, dictionaries in Python 
These tests also test my abilities to use, conditionals, loops, functions in Python.
There is a timeout, so my code has to be efficient.
