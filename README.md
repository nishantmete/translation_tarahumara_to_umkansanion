# translation_tarahumara_to_umkansanion
Conversion of the songs in Tarahumara songs into the Umkansanion script. 
The problem is basically to convert the song in Tarahumara script to the Umkansanion script, it is explained at the start in the file program01.py, which is where the whole source code is. To run the tests on the program download all the files from: 
In summary, I have to access the index.txt file in the test(n) folder. The index.txt file contains the song names and file paths on each line. 
I have to access the files using the paths given, next I have to translate the files, now in Tarahumara scripts, the songs are written in digits, and from right to left, and in umknasanion scipt the songs are written in using the Alphabets, and from left to right, there are many factors, kindly refer to the starting paragraph of the program01.py file. 
This problem tests my abilties of handling files i.e. wrting and reading files using Python, tests the ability to used Lists, list comprehensions, Dictionaries in Python 
This tests also test my abilities to use, conditionals, loops, functions in Python.
There is a timeout, so my code has to be efficient.
